## CodeGeneration
A Useful **Desktop** Application made in **.NET** used to **generate** and **store** passwords. <br>
All generated code follow the same format. First character is a capital, the 11th is a number <br>
and the 12th is a punctuation. <br> <br> 
When the application is launched for the first time a **file is added** to your **c:/user/appdata/local/** named **codeGenEncryption** containing a **40 character long Key**. <br> 
<br>
This application data is meant to be stored in the cloud and the user is meant to be anonymous, the key will serve to <br>
identify the user which means **each user is a unique 40 character long key**. <br>

## Prerequisite
1)  [Visual Studio ](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/community/) - Download Visual Studio </pre>
2)  [.NET 4.7.2 ](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet-framework/net472) -  .NET Framework 4.7.2 </pre>
3) [MySql WorkBench ](https://www.mysql.com/products/workbench/) - Download MySql WorkBench  (Choose this option or option 4 )
4) [Alwaysdata.com](https://alwaysdata.com/) - MySql Cloud Host (Choose this option or option 3 )

## Open and execute
1) Open the project with visual studio
2) In utilitaire.cs the method persistAccess and GetAccess requires a valid MySql connection string 
3) Download the SQL File located in the repository and insert the script in your MySql Server. (Mysql WorkBench can be used)
4) Run the application.

## Deploy on Windows 
To deploy it as a desktop application : In visual studio go to Generate > Publish CodeGeneration > Next > 3rd Option > Next > Finish.

## Functionalities
**AddCodeFile(string)** - This function add a text file in your c:/user/appdata/local/ which contains a 40 character long key and then returns the key. 
The parameter string in this method is a 40 character long key generated by the function generatePasswordLength40() ;

**ReadCodeFile()** - This function find, open and read the 40 character long key located in the  c:/user/appdata/local/codeGenEncryption.txt and returns it.

**NumberBetweenZeroAndNine(Random)** - This function generate a random number from 0 and 9 using the Random Class and returns it.

**randomCapitalLetter(Random, ASCIIEncoding)** - This function generate a capital letter with the help of the ASCIIEncoding and Random classes and returns it.

**randomTinyLetter(Random, ASCIIEncoding)** - This function generate a tiny letter with the help of the ASCIIEncoding and Random classes and returns it.

**randomPunctuation(Random, ASCIIEncoding)** - This function generate a random puctuation with the help of the ASCIIEncoding and Random classes and returns it.

**randomLetter_Number_Punction(Random, ASCIIEncoding)** - This function generate a random letter (capital or tiny) or a random number or a random puctuation with the help of the ASCIIEncoding and Random classes and returns it.

**addSpaceBar(Random, ASCIIEncoding)** - This function generate a space (" ")  with the help of the ASCIIEncoding and Random classes and returns it.

**numberBetweenOneAndThree(Random)** - This function generate a random number from 1 and 3 using the Random Class and returns it.

**numberBetweenOneAndTwo(Random)** - This function generate a random number from 1 and 2 using the Random Class and returns it.

**showloadingLabels()** - This function set different label to visible status.

**loadProgressBar()** - This function set the maximum value and the current value of the progress bar and returns the progressBar.

**changeCursor()** - This function sets the default cursor to a Waiting cursor while the progress bar is launched and progressing.

**emptyPasswordField()** - This function checks if there is content in the field where the password is going to be generated. 
If the field is not empty, it will clear it.

**generatePasswordLength12(Random, ASCIIEncoding, string)** - This function is used to fill the progressBar and generates a password of 12 characters. 
The first letter is a Capital letter, the following 9 characters are tiny letters, the 11th character is a number and the 12th character is a punctuation.
The method loadProgressBar(int), randomCapitalLetter(), randomTinyLetter(), randomPunctuation(), numberBetweenOneAndThree(), NumberBetweenZeroAndNine()  are called in this function.

**generatePasswordLength40(Random, ASCIIEncoding, string)** - This function is used to generate a password of 40 characters. 
This method doesn't have the same process as the one that generates a 12 character long with a defined sequence. 
It generates capital letters, tiny letters, numbers and punctuation anywhere and it can only generate one space (" ").
The method randomCapitalLetter(), randomTinyLetter(), randomPunctuation(), randomLetter_Number_Punction, addSpaceBar(), NumberBetweenZeroAndNine(), numberBetweenOneAndThree(), numberBetweenOneAndTwo()  are called in this function.

**refreshForm()** - This function is used to refresh the form once the button generate has been clicked so that the labels display at the right time.

**setCustomLabelBgColor()** - This function is used to set the background color of the labels to the same color as the background picture.

**saveAccess(string platform, string password, string key)** - This function is used to store in the database the data of the user.
The DaoAccess Class is called and The method persistPassword(string query, Object Access) is called in this function.

**getAccess()** - This function is used to retrieve data from a user.
The DaoAccess Class is called and the method getAccess(string query, string key) is called in this function.

**verifyFirstTimeUser(Random, ASCIIEncoding)** - This function is used once the program is executed. It checks if the txt file exists in its repository and if it doesn't it is added.
The method generatePasswordLength40() and addCodeFile() are called in this function.

**beforePasswordGenerated()** - This function call several other methods before the password is fully generated.
The method emptyPasswordField(), changeCursor(), showProgressBar(), setCustomLabelBgColor(), showloadingLabels(), refreshForm() are called in this specific order.

**afterPasswordGenerated()** - This function call several other methods after the password is fully generated.
changeCursor(), MessageBox.Show(), showProgressBar(), showloadingLabels() are called in this specific order.
